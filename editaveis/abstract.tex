\begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

Handicapped people, in a certain degree, needs continuous monitoring in
order to prevent accidents or other issues. Besides that, in some cases, the
presence of a carer is needed to help with the wheelchair, and to track vital
signals.
Technologies in this field are not evolving fast enough, does not solve
these scenarios at the same time, and, even more, are costly.
In this work we present UMISS, an electric wheelchair that tracks vital
signals, notifies critical events, and moves without third party intervention.
With UMISS we expect to create a low cost solution, that allows the
patient to securely take care of himself.
